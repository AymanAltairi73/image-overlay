#Image Overlay using HTML, CSS, and SCSS

### Overview:
The Image Overlay technique involves overlaying a transparent layer on top of an image, typically with content or design elements to enhance the user experience. Common use cases include displaying text captions, buttons, icons, or color filters over the image to create emphasis or interactivity.

### Key Components:
1. HTML Structure: The HTML markup defines the structure of the image and overlay content, usually using a container element for the image and overlay elements.
2. CSS Styling: CSS is used to style the image, overlay, and their respective elements, defining properties like position, size, transparency, hover effects, and transitions.
3. SCSS Enhancements: SCSS (Sassy CSS) can be utilized to write more maintainable and flexible CSS code, including variables, mixins, nesting, and inheritance for improved styling efficiency.

### Features of Image Overlay:
- Transparency: Implementing a semi-transparent overlay to maintain visibility of the underlying image.
- Text and Content: Adding text, buttons, or icons on the overlay to provide information or interactive elements.
- Hover Effects: Incorporating hover effects to change the appearance of the overlay on user interaction.
- Responsive Design: Ensuring the overlay adapts to different screen sizes for a consistent user experience.
- Animation: Applying CSS animations or transitions to create dynamic effects when hovering or interacting with the image.

### Benefits of Using HTML, CSS, and SCSS:
- Customization: Allows for extensive customization of the overlay design and layout.
- Scalability: Facilitates the creation of reusable styles and components for future projects.
- Performance: Optimizes the styling code for improved performance and maintainability.
- Flexibility: Enables developers to experiment with different design variations and effects.
